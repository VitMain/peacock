Included are STL and STEP files, intended for FDM 3D printing.

Also included are DXF and SVG files intended as a template for making a trackpad overlay (e.g. from Self adhesive vinyl).

The case is designed for m3 hardware in the corners- I used m3x6mm. There is 1 spot for an m2x6mm screw in the centre of the macropad.

Optionally, you can use longer m3 bolts to tilt the back of the case up for comfort.

Additionally files with a 5 degree tilt applied to the base of the case have also been provided for better ergonomics.
